# Servo Safety: Gripper-Only Physical Tests

- For any physical movement test on real hardware, move only gripper joints.
- Do not perform exploratory or validation movement on arm base, shoulder, elbow, or wrist joints.
- If a test requires actuation, use minimal-amplitude gripper motion first.
- If broader movement seems necessary, stop and ask the user before proceeding.
